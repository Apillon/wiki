It offers a secure, non-custodial, and fully decentralized solution for managing crypto assets seamlessly within applications.</p><h2 id="what-is-an-embedded-wallet" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-an-embedded-wallet" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What is an Embedded Wallet?</h2><p>An embedded wallet is an in-app wallet that provides a streamlined experience for generating and signing transactions with your private key, without requiring separate downloads or installations. By integrating directly into applications via an SDK, embedded wallets simplify onboarding, allowing users to log in with just their email and a verification code. This setup eliminates mnemonic phrases, making the experience accessible and secure.</p><h2 id="how-it-works" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-it-works" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How it Works</h2>',6),h=e("li",null,[e("strong",null,"Integration"),t(": Developers integrate the wallet using a lightweight SDK.")],-1),p=e("li",null,[e("strong",null,"Authentication"),t(": Users register with an email and verification code, bypassing mnemonic phrases.

This allows for a secure and user-friendly experience that prioritizes privacy.</p><h3 id="how-passkeys-work" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-passkeys-work" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How Passkeys Work</h3><p>Upon setting up a passkey, the user’s device generates a cryptographic key pair: a public key (shared with the service) and a private key (stored on the device). When logging in, the user authenticates biometrically, which unlocks the private key to sign the login request. The service verifies this signed request using the public key.</p><h3 id="benefits-of-passkeys" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#benefits-of-passkeys" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Benefits of Passkeys</h3><ol><li><strong>Enhanced Security</strong>: The private key remains on the device, reducing risk of theft.</li><li><strong>User Convenience</strong>: Biometric login removes the need to remember passwords.</li><li><strong>Phishing Protection</strong>: The private key is non-transferrable, making it immune to phishing attacks.</li></ol><p>Apillon’s passkeys ensure wallets are protected with advanced biometric-based security, creating a seamless user experience.</p><h2 id="advantages-of-apillon-s-embedded-wallet-service" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#advantages-of-apillon-s-embedded-wallet-service" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Advantages of Apillon’s Embedded Wallet Service</h2><ul><li><strong>Seamless User Experience</strong>: Simplifies onboarding, requiring no wallet downloads.</li><li><strong>Secure Wallet Setup</strong>: No mnemonic keys are required.
