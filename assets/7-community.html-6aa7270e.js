The influx of talent and ideas would fuel the creation of diverse and innovative decentralized applications built on the Polkadot network, leading to increased usage, adoption, and overall ecosystem growth. Additionally, by providing a streamlined development experience and facilitating the integration of various parachains, Apillon&#39;s platform contributes to the scalability and interoperability of the network, making it more appealing to developers and users alike.</p><h4 id="what-impact-would-polkadot-treasury-funding-have-on-the-apillon-platform" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-impact-would-polkadot-treasury-funding-have-on-the-apillon-platform" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What impact would Polkadot Treasury funding have on the Apillon platform?</h4><p>The backing of Polkadot Treasury funding would tremendously impact the Apillon platform.

### Overview

Whether a developer or non-technical Web3 enthusiast, every member of the Apillon community is invited to become more involved in Apillon’s venture. We are looking for passionate and devoted Web3 believers to support and spread Apillon’s mission — accelerating Web3 adoption by continuously empowering its builders.

The application for the Apillon Ambassador program is available [here](https://surveys.apillon.io/).

### Benefits

By joining the Apillon Ambassador program, one would:

- Get early previews of the work in progress at Apillon.
- Engage with high-level Web3 individuals and join exclusive events.
- Receive free Apillon-branded merch.
- Gain access to in-person meets and conferences with the Apillon [](https://)team.

### How does it work?

_Current version: 1.0 (January 2023)_

The first step in the Ambassador program is an Apillon Candidate position. The go-to tool is Crew3, which is an easy-to-use platform where all participants can follow and perform available tasks and keep track of their overall progress. The leaderboard’s top Apillon Candidates will be invited to join the next step and become Apprentices.

Apillon Apprentices will receive personal guidance from Apillon’s Community manager and from Apillon Senior Ambassadors. Apprentices will be able to join video calls to connect with their guides/mentors and discuss what tasks best fit Apillon’s vision and match Apprentices’ level of knowledge and engagement.

Depending on the demonstrated level of commitment and activity, Apprentices will have a chance to become Apillon Ambassadors after they provide proof of
work for the past 30 days.

Apillon Ambassador will be entrusted with additional tasks, which will be rewarded regularly, if carried out in a professional manner. Hard work and dedication will lead the Ambassadors to the role of Apillon Senior Ambassadors, and they’ll be coordinating a group of Apillon Ambassadors independently.

And finally, based on the added value, consistently brought to the table over an extended period of time, Apillon Senior Ambassadors will be promoted to Apillon Evangelists. The tasks will entail coordinating a group of Apillon Senior Ambassadors, running monthly sync calls, and taking on other important responsibilities (discussed at a later stage).

### Ambassador program tiers

- Tier 1: **[Apillon Candidate](#apillon-candidate)** (performing tasks on Crew3 platform).
- Tier 2: **[Apillon Apprentice](#apillon-apprentice)** (performing tasks proactively, receiving personalized guidance from the Apillon core team and Apillon Senior Ambassadors).
- Tier 3: **[Apillon Ambassador](#apillon-ambassador)** (participating through different content niches, receiving guidance and overview from the Apillon core team).
- Tier 4: **[Apillon Senior Ambassador](#apillon-senior-ambassador)** (offering guidance, providing task overview, running tasks from different fields).
- Tier 5: **[Apillon Evangelist](#apillon-evangelist)** (performing very personalized and specialized tasks).

#### Apillon Candidate

Each individual applying to the program starts out as a Candidate for the Apillon Ambassador program. Every applicant will be emailed a link to the Apillon Crew3 space, where the Apillon team posts and regularly updates tasks to be carried out. Crew3 is an easy-to-use tool where one can track their own progress, pick their favorite tasks and complete them, and compete for the leaderboard’s top spots.

Each task-fulfilling process (called a sprint) will be available for 30 days. All Candidates will be eligible in every task sprint, scoring points for fulfilled and approved assignments, and following the ranking on the leaderboard.

All Apillon Candidates will not manage to advance to the next level will be eligible to enter a new 30-day sprint and try again. No rewards are yet offered at this stage.

Note: forming Candidates: Anyone can apply to become a Candidate, but Apillon reserves the right to always define priority candidate listing according to geographical preference. The goal of the Apillon Ambassador program is to have ambassadors spread evenly across the world, so once a specific country has a sufficient number of ambassadors, the Candidates from that country or region might be denied in new Crew3 sprints.

#### Apillon Apprentice

Once becoming Apillon Apprentice, one will be assigned to work with either Apillon Senior Ambassadors or with Apillon’s Community Manager to follow the Apprentice’s progress and offer personalized guidance. Apprentice’s work at this stage mainly depends on which niches they want to be more active in during the later stages of the program - they will be able to choose their preferred content niche (see below) as a trial period and, for the next 30-60 days, show their skills and set the level of what can be expected of them.

It is mandatory for Apprentices to be proactive - educating themselves on all things Apillon so they can become more active on social media channels: engaging in conversations and answering general questions on Apillon Telegram groups and Apillon Discord.

Each Apillon Apprentice will get be assessed by the Apillon Community manager to make sure their work and knowledge are sufficient to advance to the Apillon Ambassador position. No rewards are yet offered at this stage.

#### Apillon Ambassador

Once Apprentices become Apillon Ambassadors, they will be informed about nine (9) different niches, where each Ambassador picks up to three (3) niches of their preference. Each of the niches will have separate tasks to attend to. A certain amount of experience points (XP) is needed to maintain the Apillon Ambassador position and at least a 3-month period before advancing to the Apillon Senior Ambassador position. Each Apillon Ambassador will still receive guidance and be monitored by an Apillon Senior Ambassador - if possible, we will provide you with the mentorship of an Ambassador in your own region.

Every 30 days, Apillon Ambassadors will be asked to provide a report as proof of their work, which will be evaluated by the Apillon Evangelist Ambassador. Rewards start at this level and will be defined more clearly at a later stage.

#### Apillon Senior Ambassador

The Apillon team will provide Senior Ambassadors with first-hand guidance and general directions, while they still work on three (3) main niches and get a chance to provide a more strategic contribution content-wise and gradually start to manage smaller groups of Apillon Apprentices.

Also, they begin organizing and hosting Ask-Me-Anything talks (AMAs), Twitter Spaces events, and Community Calls, attend conferences in their region where they represent Apillon and gain experience points (XP) for their work. This position entails voting on the Apillon Apprentices to become Apillon Ambassadors. After providing a report as proof of carried out activities and the Apillon team confirming the report, they get rewarded for their work.

Keeping the Apillon Senior Ambassador position for six (6) months makes them eligible to become nominated for Apillon Evangelists.

#### Apillon Evangelist

It is the highest and most responsible role in the Apillon Ambassador program. Apillon Evangelists keep performing their regular duties through their chosen niches, plus they start managing a few of the Apillon Senior Ambassadors. That would entail running monthly calls with the Senior Ambassadors to:
get updates about their level of engagement,
assess their contribution to the Ambassador community,
sync for an upcoming month on all the topics and future events,
find new tasks that would benefit the Apillon community,
manage other tasks, pertinent at that moment.

### Tasks and deliverables

Each program tier requires a set of tasks to be done and deliverables to be provided by each participant to be considered eligible and to proceed to the next level. For Ambassadors to have an easier overview, we’ve combined the tasks into several niches. A complete breakdown of the niches’ descriptions, guidelines and deliverables is available at this link, below you can check through the niche list and their general overview.

- **Social catalyst**: Follows, likes, (re)tweets - activation on relevant social media channels.
- **Know-It-All**: The go-to person in the Apillon community for all doubts and questions.
- **Web3 scout**: Finding and bringing new Ambassadors on board with referral links.
- **Content ninja**: Writing original blogs or other posts on all things Apillon.
- **Wordsmith**: Translating Apillon’s content to other languages, engaging local community.
- **Hawkeye**: Reporting bugs, mistakes, or possible improvements on the Apillon platform.
- **Artisan**: Expressing creativity through infographics, memes, music, videos, NFTs etc.
- **Business craftsman**: Finding and connecting to projects that could benefit from Apillon.
- **Showman**: Hosting online events for your local community.

### How to apply

After submitting your application [here](https://surveys.apillon.io/), you’ll receive a return email with next steps and guidelines. Then, Apillon’s community manager will set up a short call with you to see if we are the right match to work together. `),y,e("p",null,[o("On June 19, on the encouragement of the key ecosystem stakeholders, Apillon submitted an "),e("a",v,[o("OpenGov discussion"),t(n)]),o(" to back upcoming proposal for Polkadot Treasury funding.")]),A,e("p",null,[e("a",k,[o("Read the full Proposal >"),t(n)])]),_,e("p",null,[o("The official discussion on the Apillon Proposal will be taking place on "),e("a",T,[o("Polkassembly"),t(n)]),o(".
