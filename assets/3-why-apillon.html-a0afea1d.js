However, even though the pace of technological progress has been outstanding, the adoption of decentralized solutions still awaits implementation in the real economy on a large scale.</p><p>Polkadot, one of the leading players in the Web3 ecosystem, is set to transform the way businesses, individuals, and organizations manage assets and data. Still, several factors hinder the broader adoption of Web3 solutions:</p><ul><li>Developers need to overcome a high entry barrier and master complex technical requirements.</li><li>Investment in Web3 development requires tons of resources, from setting up a capable team to navigating a lengthy process and delivering tried and tested results.</li><li>Price-performance ratio of Web3 solutions is often, albeit wrongfully, seen as unfavorable, as many businesses and users find them unconvincing, even risky, when it comes to employing blockchain technology in the real economy.</li><li>Most Web3 products are packaged without price stability and predictability, SLAs, guarantees, support, and other common features of reliable Web2 solutions.</li><li>A multitude of competing technologies makes it difficult to find the appropriate long-term solution.</li><li>Many service providers require an understanding of their tokenomics, and integrating multiple Web3 technologies could drastically complicate the management of utilized tokens.</li></ul><p>Apillon&#39;s unified points of access deliver the functionalities of Polkadot parachains to developers simply through APIs, so they can create a working Web3-based product from day one while mitigating or avoiding the issues above.</p><p>While each parachain is best at solving its own isolated case, Apillon is all about connecting and curating different parachains, protocols, or pallets into the right context that can be easily adopted by developers to build tangible products in Web3.</p><p>Simplification further applies to pricing, as the platform takes care of all the underlying payment requirements with a unified payment system. Payment plans in DOT or fiat (EUR, USD) deliver price stability and predictability, ideal for enterprises and frequent users.</p><p>Building with Apillon does not require prior knowledge of blockchain technology and surpasses the hassle of lengthy testing and auditing. A streamlined product development substantially reduces the go-to-market timeline and resources spent in the process.</p><p>Apillon brings the power of distributed technologies to web developers and opens the floodgate to their widespread adoption. It democratizes the usability of advanced technologies and helps Web3 services reach wider and deeper.</p><h2 id="unified-pricing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#unified-pricing" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Unified pricing</h2><p>Unpredictable pricing of Web3 services hinders adoption as users cannot foresee the costs generated in the process of using them. The Apillon platform delivers various Web3 services at stable pricing and allows users to devote more time and energy to developing new products.</p><h3 id="predictable-pricing-for-greater-adoption" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#predictable-pricing-for-greater-adoption" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Predictable pricing for greater adoption</h3><p>The Web3 space delivers outstanding possibilities for building advanced decentralized products. However, the projects providing Web3 services have mostly focused on perfecting the technology offering and less on how end-users interact with it and adopt it.</p><p>One of the main challenges users need to overcome in Web3 services adoption is token/asset acquisition and management. This could seem like a minor issue when using a single service but could grow into an overwhelming toil when utilizing multiple at once.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Apillon is a Web3 development platform that gathers and delivers complex blockchain solutions and protocols through a simplified and unified API endpoint, allowing developers to build Web3 projects quickly, effectively and with predictable pricing.&quot; Apillon Tokenomics Whitepaper</p></blockquote><p>To deliver as smooth a user experience as possible, the Apillon platform performs automatic payments of underlying services in their native tokens and enables users to pay for all in a single transaction.</p><h3 id="predictable-scaling" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#predictable-scaling" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Predictable scaling</h3><p>Each successful startup goes through typical development phases. First, after the initial idea, they build a prototype and MVP to create traction. Once they perfect their offering in the product-market fit phase, they work towards boosting growth in the scaling phase.</p><p>In supporting Web3 builders through their growth process, Apillon delivers a full-stack solution that allows both startups and established companies to develop and scale their products using Web3 building services.</p><p>Too often, as they work on perfecting the product-market fit, initial-stage businesses are not focused much on the costs that come with using different services. However, in the following phase, scaling the business model becomes a much more pragmatic issue, as it requires a lot of mid- to long-term planning and continuous cost optimization.</p><p>And this can only be achieved by utilizing services with reliable, predictable pricing models.</p><h3 id="token-utility-volatility-and-predictable-pricing-paradox" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#token-utility-volatility-and-predictable-pricing-paradox" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Token utility, volatility, and predictable pricing paradox</h3><p>In the Web3 world, the pricing of most protocols, parachains, and services is typically based around a volatile token. This is directly correlated with project tokenomics, as they aim to boost token value with different token utilities, some more successfully, some less. Moreover, token valuation is heavily subject to market sentiment and community backing.</p><p>Charging for Web3 services in volatile tokens leads to unpredictable pricing models, which prevents their users from scaling successfully and reining their spending within rational range.</p><p>The unpredictability of service pricing is a huge issue in the current stage of the Web3 space, regardless of (or because of) ever-changing market sentiment. With the implementation of stable service pricing, Apillon provides the platform users with tools to build stellar Web3 products while allowing them to forecast their financial statements and cash flows for stable growth.</p><h3 id="multiple-services-at-a-single-price-tag" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#multiple-services-at-a-single-price-tag" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Multiple services at a single price tag</h3><p>Paying for services with a highly volatile asset is both risky and cumbersome. It is mainly because, in Web3, highly volatile assets represent more an investment vehicle than a value transfer instrument.</p><p>The Apillon platform is designed to accept payments in either fiat money, stablecoins, or even volatile assets. As it cannot impact the utility of supported parachains&#39; native tokens, the platform sustains a pricing model that resists their volatility and provides users with stable monthly pricing. This way, they can adequately plan the resources spent on Web3 projects.</p><p>While Apillonâ€™s pricing model can buffer normal average asset volatility of supported services, it is not designed to withstand cases of dramatic or black swan events on the market.</p><p>The Apillon platform and its pricing is built using the following approaches:</p><ul><li>A staged business model from freemium to paid plans</li><li>Underlying credit points for monitoring and calibration of pricing models</li><li>Asset custody for underlying service payments</li><li>Stablecoins as a stable store of value between user payment and service cost</li><li>Connection to a DEX for automatic asset swap</li><li>Real-time price and custody monitoring</li><li>1:1 deals with service providers on price insurance</li></ul><p>The Apillon MVP supports a freemium model to bring the above points into equilibrium. With stably priced services and unified payment, it further helps Apillon&#39;s business model to stand the test of the crypto market.</p>',33),s=[n];function r(l,c){return i(),t("div",null,s)}const d=e(o,[["render",r],["__file","3-why-apillon.html.vue"]]);export{d as default};
