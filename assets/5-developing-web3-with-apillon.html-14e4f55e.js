Examples used do not intend to imply in any way that either KILT or Crust are challenging to use but merely to show that these processes require serious work and introduce friction in cases where developers utilize several parachains to build a single solution.</em></p>',20),a=[l];function r(s,d){return i(),t("div",null,a)}const h=e(n,[["render",r],["__file","5-developing-web3-with-apillon.html.vue"]]);export{h as default};
