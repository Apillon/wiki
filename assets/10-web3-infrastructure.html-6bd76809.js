Developers can leverage existing templates as a starting point and customize them according to their specific requirements. Before deployment, indexers can be thoroughly tested in a local environment to ensure proper functionality.</p><p>An indexer implementation consists of three core components:</p><ul><li><strong>Indexer Processor</strong>: Handles data fetching and processing from the blockchain</li><li><strong>Indexer Database</strong>: Stores the processed blockchain data</li><li><strong>Indexer API</strong>: Provides GraphQL endpoint for querying the indexed data</li></ul><p>To configure an indexer, developers need to specify:</p><ul><li><strong>RPC Node Endpoint</strong>: Connection point to the blockchain network</li><li><strong>Starting Block</strong>: Initial block number from which to begin indexing</li><li><strong>Target Events and Fields</strong>: Specific blockchain events and data fields to monitor and process</li></ul><p>The indexer processor continuously fetches new blocks from the specified starting point up to the latest block, processing the relevant data according to the configured rules and storing it in the indexer database.</p><p>The processed data becomes accessible through a GraphQL API, providing a flexible and efficient way to query the indexed blockchain data. This API supports complex queries, filtering, and data relationships, enabling developers to retrieve exactly the information they need for their applications.</p><h3 id="pricing-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pricing-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pricing</h3><p>Indexers are billed based on the amount of processed and stored data and the number of queries made to the indexer API. Project need to have sufficient credit balance to deploy an indexer. The deployment itself is free of charge, Apillon charges for the working indexer only. Indexers are billed daily - each day Apillon calculates price for the indexer and uses project&#39;s credit balance to pay for it.</p><p>If project&#39;s credit balance is insufficient, indexer will be hibernated and later deleted after few days if no action is taken.</p><h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Conclusion</h2><p>Apillon&#39;s Web3 Infrastructure services provide developers with powerful tools to build and scale decentralized applications. Through SQD integration, developers can efficiently index and query blockchain data across multiple networks, while maintaining cost-effectiveness and high performance. The platform&#39;s user-friendly approach, combined with its robust technical capabilities, makes it an ideal choice for projects of any size looking to leverage blockchain data effectively.</p>',19);function f(b,w){const n=a("ExternalLinkIcon");return s(),l("div",null,[d,r("p",null,[e("The RPC (Remote Procedure Call) service in Apillon's infrastructure provides seamless connectivity to blockchain networks, allowing developers to interact with blockchain data and execute smart contracts.
