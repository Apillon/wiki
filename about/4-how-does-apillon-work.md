# How does Apillon work?

Apillon abstracts the technological complexity behind the Polkadot network and its parachains into a suite of development tools empowering developers to upgrade to Web3 easily.

The platform gathers and delivers Web3 functionalities powered by Polkadot parachains to developers through straightforward API access, and provides support with ample SDKs and complete documentation for each service.

Apillon's adaptability and interoperability allow builders to seamlessly merge use cases into single products offering different distributed services, serving their audiences more comprehensively than they could with specialized products.

## APIs

Thanks to easy integration into any development framework, the Apillon APIs introduce a new way of Web3 development that significantly simplifies the go-to-market product evolution.

Initially, the Apillon platform will incorporate APIs to the following Polkadot parachains:
* [Moonbeam](https://moonbeam.network/)
* [KILT](https://www.kilt.io/)
* [Crust](https://crust.network/)
* [Phala](https://www.phala.network/)

In the future, more APIs will be added as new parachains earn their slot on Polkadot, and new Web3 services and features are released on the network.

## SDKs

Easing the integration of the Apillon platform and its APIs, ample SDKs enable faster and more streamlined utilization of Polkadot/Kusama parachains from the first click onwards.

## Documentation

Guiding developers’ way through the individual modules and dapp development process, Apillon documentation helps avoid bugs, mitigate operational issues, and create working products with a lower risk of error and less need for auditing.

## Monitoring

With a real-time overview of back-end performance, developers gain valuable insights into the functioning of their Web3 applications and attached services, allowing them to improve on lagging features or tweak the product for better performance.

## Analytics

To help advance the adoption of Web3 products, Apillon's Analytics delivers clear insight into UI and transaction data, allowing developers to understand how their products are used, their best-performing features, and areas that need improvement.
