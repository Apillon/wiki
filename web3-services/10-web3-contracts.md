# Contracts

The Apillon Contract Service enables efficient deployment and comprehensive management of smart contracts across multiple 
blockchain networks, providing a seamless and scalable solution for developers and enterprises.

This service currently supports deploying smart contracts on various EVM-compatible blockchain networks, including:
- [Astar Network](https://docs.astar.network/docs/build/introduction/astar_family)
- [Moonbeam Network](https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/get-started/networks/moonbeam/)
- [Moonbase Network](https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/get-started/networks/moonbase/)

## Contract Deployment

Deploying a smart contract is straightforward with Apillon's streamlined process. To deploy a smart contract, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [Apillon account](https://app.apillon.io/register). 
2. Navigate to the "Contracts" section from the menu on the left and click on "New Smart Contract."
3. Select the desired smart contract for deployment. 
4. Customize the contract through the provided configuration form and initiate the deployment. 
5. Once deployed, utilize read and write methods to interact directly with the contract.

## Contract Versioning

To ensure ongoing security and feature enhancements, Apillon employs versioned smart contracts. Each deployed contract 
maintains a version to guarantee that the appropriate ABI (Application Binary Interface) is used during interactions, 
safeguarding compatibility and providing a stable experience for contract users.
